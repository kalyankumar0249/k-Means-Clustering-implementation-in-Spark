# k-Means-Clustering-implementation-in-Spark

In this project, we will analyze k-means clustering algorithms with multiple centroid initializations 
and distance measures using Apache Spark without using clustering libraries available
in Spark MLlib for this project. 

This project will help to understand the fine details of implementing clustering algorithms with 
Spark. In addition, this project will help to understand the impact of multiple cluster initialization 
techniques and distance measures
